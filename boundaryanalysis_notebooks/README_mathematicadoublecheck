Initially, I doublechecked the boundary points with a mathematica script (.wl) with the goal to check whether or not the points calculated with mathematica were within a close distance to the original ones obtained with c++. But this had two small issues. First, it would make sense to doublecheck whether the points would fall in the same grid cell or not. However, this is what I was doing at the beginning but not in the end, where I set the tolerance to a value bigger than the grid cell size. Second, I was considering as a non-coincident point whenever position and/or steepness would fall into cells of bigger values, but not smaller. This was subsequently fixed in a script (*_count) that also prints a file (*allcomparisons)  with details of the coincident and non-coincident points so that I can then report the statistics. This was executed from notebooks that have in the name *doublecheckonly except for the N4univ_lr or N4univ_ul, where it was done directly on the full analysis notebook since these two boundaries were run at the end in order to replace the previous wing calculations that had been done with grid cell sizes bigger than the rest.
